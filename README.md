# TIC-TAC-TOE
Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns marking X or O in a 3×3 grid, aiming to get three in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This project demonstrates core web development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic.
